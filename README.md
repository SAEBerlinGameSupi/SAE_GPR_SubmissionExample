# SAE_GPR_SubmissionExample

This repository shows an example of how a typical 
Game Programming submission should look like. 
The "info.txt" files present are to provide explanations
and should not be in the real submission.

The example submission is a Unity project, but the same structure also applies
to other forms of submission (Visual Studio Project, UE4)

The example submission is: GPR6600_S1_LucaMartinelli.zip

Note that GPR6600_S1 should be replaced with the correct module and assignment
